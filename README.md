# FlappyCat
<<<<<<< HEAD
Using PyGame to create a FlappyCat game based on FlappyBird.

v2.0:

1. Drew outlines for the scores.
2. Add two new features named "fresh flower" and "bad flower"; add sounds for both of them.
   1. If the cat get the fresh flower, `score` += 10, and `number of flowers` += 1. 
   2. If the cat get the bad flower, `score` -= 5, and `number of flowers` -= 1.
   3. You can use three flowers for one revive chance.
3. The base scrolls more fluently.
